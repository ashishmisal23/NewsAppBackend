# News App Backend

This project is the backend for a news application built using Node.js with Express.

## Features

- **API Endpoints**: Provides endpoints for user authentication, news articles CRUD operations, and user profile management.
- **User Authentication**: Handles user registration, login, and logout using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
- **Database Integration**: Interacts with MongoDB for storing user data and news articles.
- **Error Handling**: Implements robust error handling for better reliability.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone "https://github.com/ashishmisal23/NewsAppBackend.git"
   ```

2. Navigate into the backend directory:

   ```bash
   cd News-App/server
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Set up environment variables:

   Create a `.env` file in the backend directory with the following variables:

   ```plaintext
   PORT=5000
   MONGO_URL=your-mongodb-url
   JWT_SECRET=your-jwt-secret
   ```

   Replace `your-mongodb-url` with the URL of your MongoDB database and `your-jwt-secret` with a secret key for JWT.

5. Run the development server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   This will start the backend server.

6. Access the API endpoints using tools like Postman or integrate with the frontend.
